```bash
git clone https://github.com/metacall/embedding-ruby-example.git
mkdir embedding-ruby-example/build && cd embedding-ruby-example/build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --target install
```

## Run

From project root directory, run the following commands:

```bash
export LOADER_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/lib"
export LOADER_SCRIPT_PATH="`pwd`"
embedding-ruby-example
```

## Docker

Building and running with Docker:

```bash
docker build --build-arg DISABLE_CACHE=`date +%s` -t metacall/embedding-ruby-example .
docker run --rm -it metacall/embedding-ruby-example
```
